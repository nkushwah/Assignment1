# ###  Install Jupyter notebook and run the first program and share the screenshot of the output.

# In[4]:


print('Hello world!!')


# 
# 

# ### Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# In[17]:


result = []
for item in range(2000,3201):
    if(item%7==0 and item%5!=0):
        result.append(item)
print(', '.join([str(x) for x in result]))

# 

# ### Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

# In[26]:


if __name__ == '__main__':
    FirstName = input()
    LastName = input()
    print(f"{LastName} {FirstName}")

# ### Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm. Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

# In[32]:


import math 
dia = 12 
volume = round(((4/3)*(math.pi)*(dia**3)),2)
print(volume)
print(f"Volume of {dia}cm of sphere is {volume}cubic cm")


# 
# 

# ## Task 2:

# ### Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list.

# In[40]:


if __name__ == '__main__':
    stringInput = input()
    listInput = stringInput.split(',')
    print(listInput)
